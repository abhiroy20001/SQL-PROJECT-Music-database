SAMPLE hashtag#sqlproject -1 💻

Ongoing learning should be persistent along with practical implementation through sample or live projects.📊

In continuation of my hashtag#dataanalytics learning I tried executing the foundation and basics of hashtag#sql in PostgreSQL Global Development Group over a sample

project from a YouTube channel name Rishabh Mishra to whom I'm grateful as I was able to practice coding in hashtag#sql with a good set of data which has definitely

made my learning quite comprehensive.💥

Some of the 🗝️ analysis of this sample project👇

Functions executed :

💡Postgresql installation and setup

💡 Setting the postgre 15 bin path through original drive location (as this may lead to failing in query execution of the database) in preferences.

💡Database creation: music_database

💡Tables inserted through the provided files and ensuring the same under the schemas.

💡 Executing SQL query operations in query tool using DQL, DDL and DML codes.
